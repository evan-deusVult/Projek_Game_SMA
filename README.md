# Game Projects Collection

This is a collection of game projects I created during high school, specifically in the programming extracurricular (SINTECH).  
These games were developed using **pygame**, a Python module designed for game development.  

## Games Included:
1. **Snake Game**
2. **Pong**
3. **Pixel** (concept similar to Super Mario Bros)

## **How to Run the Projects**:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/Projek_Game_SMA.git
cd Projek_Game_SMA
```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
- On **Windows**:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
- On **Mac/Linux**:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Run the Game**:
Run the game by executing the source_code.py file inside the folder of your chosen game:
```bash
python source_code.py
```

6. **Note**:
Ensure Python and Pygame are installed on your system before starting.
